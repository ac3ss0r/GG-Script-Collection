# GG-Script-Collection

## About
When I mod games and create scripts/patches I have to work with scripts made by other people a lot - to learn, reverse them (find old offsets and update), etc. This game me an idea to create an automated tool that collects as many scripts as possible for a certain game, then formats/sorts & deobfuscates them automatically if possible.

Most people won't find this very useful, but as a perfectionist I find it very handy while investigating a ways to mod something, that already has public scripts avaliable.

## Libraries & tools used

- <a href="https://github.com/JohnnyMorganz/StyLua">stylua</a> for lua formatting
- <a href="https://github.com/scoder/lupa">lupa</a> for lua emulation

## Todo
Eventually I may implement universal deobfuscation and script decompilation, but for now it's work in progress only
