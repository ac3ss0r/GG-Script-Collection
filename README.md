# GG-Script-Collection

## About
This is an automated tool for parsing, sorting and deobfuscating game guardian scripts from different resources, including the actual script collection that can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/ac3ss0r/GG-Script-Collection/tree/main/saved">saved</a> folder.

In the mobile game modding community many people comply about everything being skidded (stolen) from others. At this point this it getting to absurd levels, and because I always like breaking the rules and doing unusual things it gave me inspiration to create this tool that is literally intended to skid everything at the same time. Also the project was partially inspired by <a href="https://github.com/DosX-dev/FindEXEC">FindEXEC</a>. 

This is more a project for practice and fun then an actual tool, but it still can be useful for some people. **You can find a large collection of processed scripts for game guardian in the <a href="https://github.com/ac3ss0r/GG-Script-Collection/tree/main/saved">saved</a> folder.**

## Libraries & tools used

## Todo
Eventually I may implement universal deobfuscation and script decompilation, but for now it's work in progress only
